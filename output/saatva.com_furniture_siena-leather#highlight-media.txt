Frequently asked questions
How do I care for my leather platform bed?
Expand/Collapse
Keep the leather clean by brushing down with a dry or slightly damp microfiber cloth.
Only use water (distilled is best) as soaps and cleansers may remove the natural oils used to preserve the leather.
Allow the leather to air dry completely after wiping.
Treat with a quality leather conditioner once a year to maintain the leather’s luxurious finish.
Avoid scratching or puncturing the leather by keeping sharp or rough objects away from the bed frame.
Keep the leather from prolonged exposure to direct sunlight and direct cooling or heating elements like an AC unit or space heater. This will ensure that the leather’s natural beauty and color will last for years to come.
What is aniline leather?
Expand/Collapse
Aniline leather is considered by most experts to be the best type of leather available. It shows off the natural grain patterns and markings, each hide with its own unique grain characteristics.
Aniline leather is made with only the most durable part of the animal hide. The processing step doesn’t include sanding, so the leather retains its natural appearance. The leather develops a beautiful patina as it ages, getting more supple and distinctive with time.
What type of wood is used in your upholstered furniture?
Expand/Collapse
Our factory handcrafts our upholstered furniture using kiln dried rubberwood or acacia hardwoods.
How can I make my bed frame higher?
Expand/Collapse
If you prefer a bed that sits higher, the best place to start is your mattress. A thicker mattress, like our
Saatva HD
which sits 15.5" high or our
Saatva Classic
in the 14.5" height option, will give your bed added height.
How much weight can a bed frame hold?
Expand/Collapse
In general, bed frames should be able to support both the weight of its compatible mattress size plus the weight that a conventional mattress can hold.
If you have a heavy-duty mattress (like our
Saatva HD
) that’s designed for sleepers who weigh between 300 to 500 pounds per side, you might consider reinforcing it with an additional layer of support or a heavy duty mattress foundation. Our Saatva HD foundation is available to use specifically with our Saatva HD mattress.
You can also add a
bunkie board or plywood
over your regular mattress foundation, box spring, or over your slatted platform bed frame to give it more support.
What Saatva mattresses are your platform bed bases compatible with?
Expand/Collapse
Our platform bed frames can be used with any Saatva mattress. In order to pair our slatted platform bed frame with our Zenhaven dual-sided natural latex mattress, you must cover the slats with a solid material, such as plywood.
Does a platform bed need a box spring or foundation?
Expand/Collapse
No. Platform beds don’t require a box spring or foundation.
Can I use a foundation or box spring on a platform bed frame?
Expand/Collapse
Technically, yes. You can add a foundation or box spring on top of our platform beds to add more height to your bed.
However, the foundation will be visible above the side rails and the additional height of the foundation or box spring may cause your mattress to obscure part of your headboard.
If a taller bed height is a priority for you, consider purchasing a bed frame with a taller headboard or pairing your bed frame with a thicker mattress like the 14.5"  Saatva Classic.
Our
Saatva Foundation
comes in a taller 8.75" option to add even more bed height.
Can I use an adjustable base with any bed frame?
Expand/Collapse
Saatva adjustable bases are compatible with all Saatva bed frames except for the Sydney, Halle Storage Platform & Halle Storage Bed. They're also compatible with most other bed frames. Contact the manufacturer of your non-Saatva bed frame to make sure it's compatible with an adjustable base.
Saatva adjustable bases have adjustable legs that go up in half-inch increments for bed height options of 13" to 18" to accommodate different frame styles. Its zero clearance design is compatible with most lower-profile platform beds and allows the adjustable base to be used without legs, measuring about 8" from the ground to the adjustable base platform.
Remember that our FREE white glove delivery service includes not only free in-room delivery, but also free assembly & setup.
NOTE: Adjustable bases are not compatible with platform beds that have drawers and may not work with some upholstered headboards with extra thick padding.
