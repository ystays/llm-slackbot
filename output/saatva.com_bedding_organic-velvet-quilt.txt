Frequently asked questions
What is a quilt?
Expand/Collapse
A traditional quilt is made of a three layer construction: a top side textile (typically cotton or linen), a thin middle layer of batting (typically some type of poly, wool, or cotton fill) that determines the warmth of the quilt, and a bottom side textile that is soft to the touch but also more durable. As the name suggests, these three layers are quilted together, usually with a quilt pattern like diamond, channel, pick-stitch, etc.
What’s the difference between a quilt and a comforter?
Expand/Collapse
Quilts are lighter, thinner, and less lofty than typical
comforters or duvet inserts
. Quilts are a great option for the warmer months or to add a layer of warmth on top of your comforter. Comforters are warmer and more insulated than quilts on their own because they have more fill material. Quilts sit more flush to your bed than a fluffy, lofty comforter or duvet insert.
What is the difference between a blanket and quilt?
Expand/Collapse
The main difference is in their construction. A blanket is a single layer that’s either woven, crocheted, or knitted. Blankets vary in thickness and can be used alone or as a layer on top of a top sheet or with a comforter for added warmth.
A quilt is constructed with three layers. It has an outer shell consisting of a top and bottom layer, plus a batting or fill made of either wool, down, cotton, polyester, rayon or a combination of those materials. Quilts also serve the same purpose of keeping you warm. It can be used alone or layered with other bedding.
What is the best way to clean my quilt?
Expand/Collapse
We recommend spot cleaning as needed. You can also machine wash on its own in cold water on a gentle cycle. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low and remove promptly. Mild, organic detergents work best.
What is GOTS?
Expand/Collapse
The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is the leading textile processing standard for organic fibers. Fabrics that carry the GOTS symbol must be made with at least 95% organic fiber, free of toxic chemicals, colored with nontoxic dyes, and meet strict social and environmental criteria.
What is your return policy for bedding & bath products?
Expand/Collapse

What is the exchange policy for bedding?
Expand/Collapse
At this time we do not have an exchange policy for Saatva bedding. If you would like to exchange your merchandise, simply return your order and repurchase the item of your choice.
Will you offer more colors in the future?
Expand/Collapse
Our current bedding color options are thoughtfully curated to fit a more neutral color palette because they complement almost any room style with timeless simplicity. In keeping with our eco-friendly ethos, we either leave the natural fabric undyed in its beautiful natural state or use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes for our bedding.
