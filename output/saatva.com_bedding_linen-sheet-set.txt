Frequently asked questions
Are linen sheets rough?
Expand/Collapse
High quality linen should not feel scratchy or rough. There are various types of linen; some are smoother and have a more consistent feel, while others have a slightly courser texture than cotton. The high-quality linen we use in our Linen Sheet Set comes prewashed for extra softness right out of the package. The best part? They get even softer with every wash.
Why are linen sheets so good?
Expand/Collapse
Linen sheets are worth the splurge because of their amazing breathability, durability, and excellent moisture-wicking properties. They're also naturally hypoallergenic, antimicrobial, and anti-static. Linen is highly durable because of its longer and thicker threads. This means your linen sheets can last you for decades to come! Fans of linen sheets also love their relaxed, lived-in look.
Do linen sheets make you sweat?
Expand/Collapse
It's actually quite the opposite! Linen is one of the most breathable natural fabrics around and has excellent moisture-wicking properties. This is a huge plus if you tend to sleep hot or sweat through the night.
Can I iron linen sheets?
Expand/Collapse
Yes. If you prefer a more crisp-looking bed, you can iron your linen sheets. Just make sure to follow the care instructions. Linen can wrinkle easily, but part of its appeal is its effortless, relaxed style.
How long do linen sheets last?
Expand/Collapse
Because it typically has longer and thicker threads, linen is a highly durable fabric. This means your linen sheets can last you for decades if you take care of them.
How can you tell good quality linen?
Expand/Collapse
The quality of linen can best be felt in its texture. Whether it's smooth or slightly course, the fabric shouldn't feel scratchy or rough. High-quality linen will typically come prewashed for added softness.
Are linen sheets cooler than cotton sheets?
Expand/Collapse
Linen sheets are highly breathable and can absorb as much as 20% of its weight in moisture before feeling wet. This makes linen a great year-round option for those who sleep hot or sweat through the night. Because of their lighter, airy feel, linen sheets are great for the summer months, but they can also help regulate your body temperature in colder months.
What is the best way to wash my sheets?
Expand/Collapse
We’re glad you asked! Machine wash your bedding in cold water, with like colors, on a gentle cycle. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low and remove promptly—we’ve made our bedding slightly larger to account for natural shrinkage after first wash. Mild, organic detergents work best.
What is OEKO-TEX®?
Expand/Collapse
The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is the internationally accepted standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings. Products that carry the OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 seal have been tested to ensure they're free of toxic chemicals.

Expand/Collapse

What is the exchange policy for bedding?
Expand/Collapse
At this time we do not have an exchange policy for Saatva bedding. If you would like to exchange your merchandise, simply return your order and repurchase the item of your choice.
Will you offer more colors in the future?
Expand/Collapse
Our current bedding color options are thoughtfully curated to fit a more neutral color palette because they complement almost any room style with timeless simplicity. In keeping with our eco-friendly ethos, we either leave the natural fabric undyed in its beautiful natural state or use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes for our bed sheets.
