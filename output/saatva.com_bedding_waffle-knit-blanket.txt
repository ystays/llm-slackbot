Frequently asked questions
What is the difference between a blanket and quilt?
Expand/Collapse
The main difference is in their construction. A blanket is a single layer that’s either woven, crocheted, or knitted. Blankets vary in thickness and can be used alone or as a layer on top of a top sheet or with a comforter for added warmth.
A quilt is constructed with three layers. It has an outer shell consisting of a top and bottom layer, plus a batting or fill made of either wool, down, cotton, polyester, rayon or a combination of those materials. Quilts also serve the same purpose of keeping you warm. It can be used alone or layered with other bedding.
Are knit blankets warm?
Expand/Collapse
Knit blankets can vary in warmth depending on the materials used and its thickness. We use 100% cotton for our knit blanket for a balance of softness, breathability, and warmth.
What is GSM?
Expand/Collapse
GSM stands for “grams per meter” and refers to the weight of a fabric. In general, the higher the fabric’s GSM, the thicker and warmer it feels.
Below are the GSM weights of some of our bedding:
• Lightweight Down Alternative Comforter: lightweight 220 GSM
• All-Year Down Alternative Comforter: medium-weight 340 GSM
• Heavyweight Down Alternative Comforter: heavyweight 420 GSM
• Waffle Knit Blanket: medium-weight 320 GSM
What is OEKO-TEX®?

The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is the internationally accepted standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings. Products that carry the OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 seal have been tested to ensure they're free of toxic chemicals.

Will you offer more colors in the future?
Expand/Collapse
Our current bedding color options are thoughtfully curated to fit a more neutral color palette because they complement almost any room style with timeless simplicity. In keeping with our eco-friendly ethos, we either leave the natural fabric undyed in its beautiful natural state or use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes for our bed sheets.
