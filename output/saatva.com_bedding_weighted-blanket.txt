Frequently asked questions
What is a weighted blanket and what does it do?
Expand/Collapse
Weighted blankets (or "weighted comforters") are blankets with some type of weighted fill. Weighted blanket filling is typically made up of glass beads, plastic pellets, or natural grains like rice or buckwheat. Our Weighted Blanket is filled with natural glass beads.
The idea behind weighted blankets comes from something called "deep pressure stimulation" or "deep pressure therapy". It's the same pressure that soothes babies when they're being swaddled or lulls a child to sleep after they're tucked in. A weighted blanket can make you feel more secure, grounded, and calm, like the feeling of a cozy hug, helping to promote more restful sleep.
Are weighted blankets safe for kids and toddlers?
Expand/Collapse
We’ve designed our weighted blanket for adults of all body sizes and types. Our weighted blanket is not recommended for children. As a general guideline, a weighted blanket should be about 10% to 15% of your body weight.
What size weighted blanket do I need?

When it comes to finding the right weighted blanket for you, look at the weight of the blanket. As a general guideline, you want a weighted blanket that's about 10% to 15% of your body weight. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, you would look for a 15-pound weighted blanket or something close.

Do weighted blankets keep you warm?
Expand/Collapse
Yes! Because of their added weight, weighted blankets are an excellent choice for staying warm on cold nights. Our weighted blanket is covered in 100% breathable cotton velvet, so it's soft to the touch for maximum comfort.
Do you put weighted blankets over comforters?
Expand/Collapse
Our 20 lb weighted blanket is meant to be used on queen or king sized beds and can be used as a substitute for a regular comforter. For extra warmth and weight, you can layer your weighted blanket over your favorite comforter.
Is it ok to sleep with a weighted blanket every night?
