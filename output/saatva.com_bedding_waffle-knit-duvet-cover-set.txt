What makes our
waffle knit duvet cover sets
so special?
Plush yet lightweight
Classic waffle weave offers a soft, springy feel that’s cozy yet airy and adds an elegant dose of texture to any bedroom.
Healthier sleep
This product has been
OEKO-TEX® Standard 100
certified to guarantee that it’s free of harmful chemicals.
Temperature regulating
Thick, three-dimensional outline of the weave helps to retain warmth for a cozy feel, while square pockets allow air to circulate for maximum breathability, even in warmer months.
Just the right thread count
As thread counts rise, fabrics become warmer. The percale cotton backing has a thread count of 200 for the perfect balance of softness and breathability.

Frequently asked questions
What is a duvet cover?
Expand/Collapse
A duvet cover is a protective and decorative fabric layer that goes over a duvet (also called a “duvet insert”) and has some type of closure like buttons or zipper.
It's a great way to keep your duvet/duvet insert clean. You can also easily change up the look of your bed by switching out your duvet cover.
What is the best way to clean my duvet cover?
Expand/Collapse
Machine wash on its own in cold water on a gentle cycle. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low and remove promptly. Mild, organic detergents work best.
What's the difference between percale and sateen cotton?
Expand/Collapse
Percale cotton has a crisp feel with a luxe matte finish while sateen cotton has a silky-soft feel with a subtle luster.
What does a duvet set include?
Expand/Collapse
A duvet set comes with a duvet cover and pillowcase/s or shams. Our Saatva duvet sets come with matching shams which are designed to be more decorative and placed over your duvet cover.
Depending on the size, a duvet cover set comes with one standard/queen pillowcase or sham for twin-twin XL, or two standard/queen or king size pillowcases or shams for queen and king/Cal king.
What is the difference between a duvet and a comforter?
Expand/Collapse
The terms “comforter” and “duvet” (also known as “duvet insert”) are sometimes used interchangeably. Traditionally, a comforter is meant to be used on its own and doesn’t require a cover. It can either have a decorative print or a solid color.
In contrast, a duvet (AKA duvet insert) is designed to be used inside a duvet cover which you can wash and switch out regularly. Duvets are also typically fluffier than traditional comforters and quilts because they are filled with down alternative or some other lightweight fill.
Our
Saatva All-Year Comforter
is actually a hybrid of both. Like a comforter, it can be used on its own without a duvet because it’s super soft and machine washable. Unlike a traditional comforter, it has the cloud-like softness and lightweight breathability of a duvet.
We recommend using the All-Year Comforter as a duvet insert inside our duvet covers to give you more versatility and ease when laundry day comes around.
What is a pillow sham?
Expand/Collapse
A sham goes over a pillow and its main purpose is decorative. It typically has some sort of border to enhance the look of your pillow. Shams are meant for pillows that sit on top of a made bed. Shams and duvet covers are a quick, easy way to change up the look of your bed setup with the seasons.
Unlike regular pillowcases, which have an opening on one end,most pillow shams have an envelope flap in the middle or hidden zippers to conceal the opening for a more finished “top-of-bed” look.
What does thread count mean, and why does it matter?
Expand/Collapse
Thread count is the number of horizontal (warp) and vertical (weft) threads in one square inch of cotton fabric. The higher the thread count, the warmer the fabric becomes.
Note that thread count is only relevant to cotton sheets. It's also only one indicator of good quality. Cotton sheet thread count can vary from the 100s to 1,000 or higher. The problem is you can only get so many threads into a loom. Some bedding manufacturers might sacrifice thread quality to increase the thread count.
We chose a thread count of 300 for our sateen cotton, 200 for our percale cotton, and 180 for our percale cotton-viscose blend to achieve the perfect balance of breathability, softness, and durability. We only use long-staple cotton, made from longer cotton fibers, for a stronger, smoother, more durable fabric.

blog

What is OEKO-TEX®?
Expand/Collapse
The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is the internationally accepted standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings. Products that carry the OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 seal have been tested to ensure they're free of toxic chemicals.

What is the exchange policy for bedding?
Expand/Collapse
At this time we do not have an exchange policy for Saatva bedding. If you would like to exchange your merchandise, simply return your order and repurchase the item of your choice.
Will you offer more colors in the future?
Expand/Collapse
Our current bedding color options are thoughtfully curated to fit a more neutral color palette because they complement almost any room style with timeless simplicity. In keeping with our eco-friendly ethos, we either leave the natural fabric undyed in its beautiful natural state or use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes for our bedding.
