Frequently asked questions
Are flannel sheets warmer than cotton sheets?
Expand/Collapse
Flannel is a thicker woven textile that is designed to retain warmth on colder nights ever better than high thread-count cotton. Our flannel cotton has a brushed finish that gives it a rich, velvety texture that’s perfect for cozying up in colder weather.
What is the best way to wash my sheets?
Expand/Collapse
We’re glad you asked! Machine wash cold on a gentle cycle with like colors, tumble dry low. Do not bleach. Mild, organic detergents work best.
What is OEKO-TEX®?
Expand/Collapse
The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is the internationally accepted standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings. Products that carry the OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 seal have been tested to ensure they're free of toxic chemicals.
What is your return policy for bedding & bath products?
Expand/Collapse
Bedding and bath products returned within 45 days of the delivery date will get a full refund to the original form of payment. There are no restocking or penalty fees for used products, but we do ask that you wash any used products before returning.
To make a bedding or bath return, simply call
1-877-672-2882
or email

. If you received our bedding as a gift, please call us for help with your return.
What is the exchange policy for bedding?
Expand/Collapse
At this time we do not have an exchange policy for Saatva bedding. If you would like to exchange your merchandise, simply return your order and repurchase the item of your choice.
Will you offer more colors in the future?
Expand/Collapse
Our current bedding color options are thoughtfully curated to fit a more neutral color palette because they complement almost any room style with timeless simplicity. In keeping with our eco-friendly ethos, we either leave the natural fabric undyed in its beautiful natural state or use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes for our bed sheets.
