What is a hybrid foam mattress?
Expand/Collapse
Memory Foam Hybrid is a  hybrid foam mattress that combines the deep, body-contouring support of memory foam with the responsive support and "bouncy" feel of an innerspring mattress. They're great for just about all types of sleepers, whether you're a back sleeper, side sleeper, or a combination of both.
What is memory foam made of?
Expand/Collapse
Memory foam, also known as viscoelastic foam, is a type of high-density polyurethane foam. Its distinguishing feature is that it softens in response to heat and pressure. That’s what gives memory foam mattresses their body-hugging, body-contouring feel.
How long do memory foam mattresses last?
Expand/Collapse
The durability of a foam mattress can vary greatly depending on the quality and density of the foams. A premium, high-quality memory foam mattress should last you anywhere from 10 to 15 years.
Are memory foam mattresses hot?
Expand/Collapse
Traditional foam mattresses have a tendency to trap body heat, but new technologies like gel-infused memory foams have come a long way in helping you sleep cooler. Saatva memory foam mattresses also feature covers made naturally breathable organic cotton.
If you tend to sleep hot, placing your memory foam mattress on a box spring or a platform with open slats will help increase overall airflow. It’s also a great idea to top off your mattress with
breathable sheets
made from natural fabrics to create a cooler, more comfortable sleep environment all around.
Are memory foam mattresses good for my back?
Expand/Collapse
Yes. Memory foam mattresses conform to your body, helping to keep your spine in a healthy, neutral alignment in any sleep position.
Consider your preferred sleeping position when shopping for a foam mattress. If you’re a side sleeper, a softer foam mattress may help reduce pressure on your shoulders and hips. If you sleep on your back or stomach, a medium-firm comfort level or firmer will prevent you from sinking too deeply into the mattress.
Are memory foam mattresses safe?
Expand/Collapse
We only use nontoxic CertiPUR-US® certified foams in our mattresses. This means that the foams are made without CFCs and other ozone depleters. They also don’t use PBDEs, TDCPP, or TCEP ("Tris"), which are flame retardants that have been identified by the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) as substances that may cause cancer, genetic defects, or damage fertility.
CertiPUR-US® compliant foams are free of phthalates, formaldehyde, and mercury, lead, or other heavy metals. They're also tested to verify low VOC (volatile organic compound) emissions, so your mattress won’t off-gas in your home.
What is gel memory foam?
Expand/Collapse
This type of memory foam is infused with a cooling gel to help to draw heat away from the body so you sleep cooler.
How do I clean a memory foam mattress?
Expand/Collapse
To make sure your mattress looks, feels, and smells its best, run your vacuum upholstery attachment through it at least a couple of times a year to get rid of dust, crumbs, dust mites, and other debris. To spot clean stains off your mattress, be sure to act quickly. Regardless of the type of stain, always check the care label on the mattress before cleanup.
Do Saatva mattresses contain fiberglass or a fiberglass sock?
Expand/Collapse
No. We never use fiberglass or toxic chemical flame retardants/barriers in any of our mattresses. Instead, we use either a plant-based flame barrier made of thistle pulp, a Paladin flame barrier made with a blend of poly & rayon fibers, or organic New Zealand wool in our mattresses to meet federal safety standards.
See Specifications under "Eco-friendly materials" for more details.
What is off gassing?
Expand/Collapse
Off gassing is the term for what happens when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) leak out of upholstery materials and mattress foams and into the air you breathe.
Some people refer to this as a "new mattress smell" that can range from unpleasant to downright nauseating.
Learn more on our
blog
about off gassing and how Saatva mattresses cut down or completely eliminate this common issue.
Do I need to flip over or rotate my mattress regularly?
Expand/Collapse
Our Zenhaven, Latex Hybrid, and Solaire mattresses do not need to be rotated from head to foot. This is due to the 5-zone alignment of the latex layer.
Our other mattresses can be rotated. We recommend rotating the mattress after six months and then once a year after that. This will ensure that the surface of the mattress breaks in evenly.
How do I clean my mattress?
Expand/Collapse
As part of regular maintenance, vacuum your mattress at least twice a year to get rid of dust, crumbs, and other icky things that might be living in there. You can also deodorize your mattress by generously sprinkling it with baking soda. Leave it on for a full day and then vacuum it up to refresh your mattress.
Tip:
Adding a
mattress pad
over your mattress gives it an added layer of protection from stains, moisture, and debris. Just make sure to wash your mattress pad regularly.

What is the best mattress for back pain?
Expand/Collapse
Picking the right mattress to help ease back pain starts with assessing your typical sleep position,  then choosing a mattress that best supports you in that position. No matter what kind of mattress you choose,
the best mattresses for back pain
should include firmer support zones for optimal spinal alignment.

        Every Saatva mattress is engineered with a dedicated lumbar zone support layer to promote healthy spinal alignment for every type of sleeper.
Do hybrid mattresses need a box spring or foundation?
Expand/Collapse
You don’t need a box spring or foundation if you have a platform bed. Otherwise, if your existing foundation or bed support system is over 7 years old or is sagging or damaged in any way, we suggest getting a high-quality
Saatva foundation
to get the most out of your new mattress. Your mattress warranty remains in place even when you use your own existing foundation or box spring.
What bed frames are Saatva mattresses compatible with?
Expand/Collapse
Saatva mattresses are compatible with any bed frame, including our Saatva bed frames.
Our dual-sided Zenhaven latex mattresses cannot be placed directly on a platform bed frame with slats. You must cover the slats with a solid material, such as plywood or a bunkie board.
Non-platform (standard) bed frames require a foundation and can be paired with any mattress. Note that Saatva HD requires pairing with the HD foundation, which is specifically designed to give it optimal support.
What is CertiPUR-US®?
Expand/Collapse
Foams that are CertiPUR-US® certified are guaranteed to be low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), so you don’t have to worry about off-gassing odors. CertiPUR-US certified foams are also guaranteed to be free of ozone depleters, PBDEs, TDCPP, and TCEP flame retardants, mercury, lead, and other heavy metals, formaldehyde, and phthalates.
What's in your exclusive Guardin™ antimicrobial treatment?
Expand/Collapse
Our exclusive antimicrobial treatment by Guardin™ is made with a proprietary blend of all-natural essential oils and minerals. This blend includes thyme, geranium, lemongrass, and mint, but is completely odorless and colorless.
Added to Saatva’s mattress ticking during the manufacturing process and engineered to last the life of the mattress, Guardin™ naturally inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, mildew, and the discoloration that they can cause on the surface of a mattress. Guardin™ antimicrobial treatment is biodegradable and does not contain any fluorocarbons, toxic heavy metals, silver nanotechnology, triclosan, formaldehyde or phthalates.
What are the benefits of the Extend protection plan?
Expand/Collapse
The Extend protection plan provides peace of mind and financial protection for your mattress investment from accidental damage.
This plan covers accidental stains and damage NOT covered by the Saatva
mattress warranty
, such as rips, tears and stains. This plan does not cover theft or damage caused by abuse or misuse.
Plans are effective from the day your mattress is delivered.

Can I try your mattresses in person?
Expand/Collapse

Our Saatva Viewing Rooms
are inviting, pressure-free spaces to experience Saatva comfort in real life.
What is white glove delivery?
Expand/Collapse
White glove delivery is the Saatva service standard and comes free with every mattress, bedroom furniture and rug order. While our teams don't actually wear white gloves, we do all the work for you.
We hand-deliver your mattress and set it up in the room of your choice. We also take away your old mattress and foundation* if you select the "free mattress & foundation removal" at checkout—all at no extra charge!
Typically, mattress orders are delivered from our factories within a 9-21 day time frame, depending on your zip code.
Our bedroom furniture is also hand-delivered and assembled (if applicable) and bedroom rugs are delivered and set up in the room of your choice (rug area must be cleared of furniture by customer prior to delivery). You get all this for free as part of our premium white glove delivery service.
*Note that there are a few items our delivery teams won't take away the following items:
Waterbed bases
Standard metal bed frames
Sleep Number bases
Stained and/or damaged mattresses & foundations/box springs
What if I need to return my mattress?
Expand/Collapse
If you aren't completely happy with your Saatva mattress during your 365-night home trial, just give us a call at
1-877-672-2882
. We’ll schedule a pick up of your mattress and issue a refund for the purchase price (taxes included) to your original method of payment.
You’ll only pay a $99 processing fee and we’ll take care of the rest!
We never resell returned mattresses. Instead, we donate them to veterans' shelters or offer them to employees and associates across our network of more than 150 delivery centers.
Our Crib Mattress is an exception with a 45-day free return.
What if I need to exchange my mattress?
Expand/Collapse
If you decide to exchange your mattress for another Saatva mattress during your 365-night home trial, just give us a call at
1-877-672-2882
. We’ll schedule a pick up of your mattress and start the exchange process.
You’ll only pay a $99 processing fee for your replacement delivery and mattress pickup, and we’ll take care of the rest!
We never resell exchanged mattresses. Instead, we donate them to veterans' shelters or offer them to employees and associates across our network of more than 150 delivery centers.
            Once your new mattress is delivered, a new 365-night home trial begins.
We’ve learned that the most common reason people exchange is for a different mattress size or height, so be sure to measure the height of your bed frame, adjustable base, and/or foundation/box spring before ordering. You can also call one of our friendly sleep guides for assistance 24/7.
Can I expedite the delivery of my mattress?
Expand/Collapse
Every Saatva mattress is made to order, which means they don't sit in storage.
Occasionally, we can shorten the delivery time when we have a change or cancellation from another order of the exact same product. This allows us to redirect that freshly made and sealed mattress to you. We’d love to help in any way if you need your mattress faster. Our friendly sleep guides are here for you 24/7 at
1-877-672-2882
.
What do I do if I think my mattress feels too firm when I receive it?
Expand/Collapse
All of our mattresses are made to order and arrive to you factory fresh. That means the high-quality materials inside them need a little bit of time to soften up. You should notice your new mattress begin to conform to your body after a few days. You may even notice continuing improvement for up to a month.
Remember that your body will need some time to
adjust to a brand new mattress.
If you've been sleeping on an old mattress, your body likely got used to it, even if it didn't provide you with adequate support. That's why we give you a generous 365-night home trial to give you time to acclimate to your new mattress.
If after a month or so, you still feel that your mattress is too firm (or too soft), give us a call at
1-877-672-2882
and one of our friendly sleep guides will be happy to help you.
Does Saatva offer any discounts to first responders, veterans, active military & more?
Expand/Collapse
We offer a year-round $225 discount off orders of $1,000 or more to active military, veterans, first responders, government employees, nurses, teachers, senior citizens & students. To apply the discount, simply click on the "Discount for first responders & more" box at checkout. You will be prompted to register with ID.me to verify your status and receive the discount. Note that your cart will automatically apply the larger discount if there is a promotional sale on Saatva.com that is better than your ID.me discount.
We also occasionally offer promotional sales for limited time periods on our products on Saatva.com and Saatva Viewing Rooms. To be one of the first to learn about our latest sales, sign up for our mailing list at our site footer or text BED to SAATVA (722882). You can unsubscribe at any time.
Are your phone and store representatives on commission?
Expand/Collapse
No. It’s part of our pledge to be honest and transparent about what you’re buying. Saatva is committed to giving you honest guidance, even if it means directing you to another mattress brand that’s a better fit for you. In a regular mattress store environment, a commissioned employee makes more money when they sell you a particular brand, so you may get pressured into a choice that’s not right for you. That’s just not the Saatva way.
What are the advantages of mattresses that are made in America?
Expand/Collapse
Mattresses made in the U.S.A. must meet strict health, safety, and environmental standards. The U.S. and the E.U. have the toughest regulations, but other countries may not offer the same protections.
Knowing where your mattress is made makes it easier to ensure that the manufacturer adheres to guidelines that protect workers from danger and exploitation, such as labor regulations and minimum-wage laws. Reputable mattresses manufacturers (like our network of 19 independent factories across the U.S.) also work to minimize environmental impact by incorporating low-carbon-footprint processes and recycled materials into their products.
