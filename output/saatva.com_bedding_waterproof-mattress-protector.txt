Frequently asked questions
Why do I need a mattress protector?
Expand/Collapse
You should consider protecting your mattress with a mattress protector if you:
are concerned about preventing bed bugs, mold, mildew & other contaminants
have pets or children that are likely to cause spills on the mattress
live in a humid region and want to protect your mattress from excess humidity
What are the differences between a mattress topper, mattress pad, and mattress protector?
Expand/Collapse
Mattress toppers are more substantial than mattress pads and protectors, typically around 1" to 4" in thickness. Rather than protect your mattress, they're designed purely to add an extra layer of comfort and support to new or older mattresses.
A mattress pad is a thin quilted layer designed to protect your mattress from light stains and general wear & tear.
Mattress protectors are thinner like fitted sheets. They're primarily used to protect your mattress from spills and humidity, making them a great choice for kids, homes with pets, and humid climates. They're also great at keeping contaminants like mold, bacteria, and bed bugs out of your mattress.
Do I put a fitted sheet over a mattress protector?
Expand/Collapse
Yes. A mattress protector is meant to be a protective barrier between you and the mattress, but it's not designed to be slept on without bed sheets.
How often should I replace a mattress protector?
Expand/Collapse
With regular use and washings, you should consider replacing your mattress protector every 5 years or so.
What's the difference between a mattress pad and a mattress topper?
Expand/Collapse
Mattress toppers
are more substantial than mattress pads and protectors, typically around 1" to 4" in thickness. Rather than protect your mattress, they're designed purely to add an extra layer of comfort and support to new or older mattresses.
Should I wash my mattress protector?
Expand/Collapse
Yes! Since your trusty mattress protector collects all the dirt, dust, and skin cells that would otherwise end up in your mattress, you should make sure to wash it regularly, every month or two - more often if you have pets or allergies.
Can a mattress protector make me sweat?
Expand/Collapse
If you pick a mattress protector that's made with breathable materials like cotton, polyurethane, or a blend of both, it shouldn't trap heat like less breathable man-made materials out there like vinyl or polyester.
What is your return policy for bedding & bath products?
Expand/Collapse
Bedding and bath products returned within 45 days of the delivery date will get a full refund to the original form of payment. There are no restocking or penalty fees for used products, but we do ask that you wash any used products before returning.
