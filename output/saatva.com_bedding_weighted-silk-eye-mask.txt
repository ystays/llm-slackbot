Frequently asked questions
What is a weighted eye mask?
Expand/Collapse
A weighted sleep mask contains some type of weighted filler material like microbeads, sand, or glass beads. It provides the same deep pressure stimulation of a weighted blanket, but for tired eyes.
What are the advantages of sleeping with a weighted eye mask?
Expand/Collapse
Just as a massage therapist might place a warm towel or bean bag over your eyes to promote relaxation, the gentle pressure from a weighted eye mask may help you decompress and relax. It’s great for soothing tired eyes and may even help relieve light headaches.
Blocking out light also signals your body to produce more of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. This can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.
Are weighted eye masks safe?
Expand/Collapse
According to the American Sleep Association, eye masks and weighted eye masks are generally safe to use. However, keep in mind the potential for allergic reactions to the material or filler type.
Our eye mask is made with naturally hypoallergenic mulberry silk, making it suitable for sensitive skin.
How do I clean my silk eye mask?
Expand/Collapse
Hand wash with mild detergent free of enzymes and bleach. Lay flat to dry. Do not tumble dry. Do not dry clean.
You can also spot clean as needed using cold water.
