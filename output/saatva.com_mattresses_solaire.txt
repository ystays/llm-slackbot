At Saatva, we never pressure you to make up your mind quickly. All of our mattresses come with a 365-night home trial, so you have plenty of time to decide whether it’s right for you.

That’s it.

Do I need special sheets for adjustable beds?
Expand/Collapse
No, unless you have an Upper-Flex or split king/cal-king adjustable bed. Queen and king Upper-Flex adjustable mattresses are split down the top half of the bed and need an
Upper-Flex fitted sheet
tailored with a center edge to accommodate it. split king/cal-king mattresses need a
split king sheet
that consists of two separate fitted sheets.
What are the pros and cons of an adjustable bed?
Expand/Collapse
The main reason people splurge on an adjustable air mattress is for chronic back pain relief.
If you share a bed with a partner and you both have different preferences for mattress firmness, an adjustable air mattress can be a true game changer. It allows both people to precisely select the perfect comfort level they need so nobody has to compromise on comfort. When paired with our Saatva Adjustable Base Plus, our Solaire Adjustable Mattress gives you even more comfort options by allowing you to raise your head and/or feet to get into a position that's most comfortable for you.
Although adjustable air mattresses can do wonders in improving the quality of your sleep, they can be significantly more expensive than other mattress types. If you get an Upper-Flex model, there's also the additional cost of an
adjustable base
to accomodate for this feature.
How do I find my ideal comfort level?
Expand/Collapse
With 50 precise firmness options, it might take some time to find the setting that feels the best to you. We recommend choosing a setting and sleeping on it for a week. If, after a week, you decide that particular comfort level isn't right for you, then experiment with different settings.
Also keep in mind that your needs might change depending on things like injuries and temporary aches & pains. That's what makes an adjustable air mattress like Solaire so unique. It allows you to adjust your bed's firmness based on your specific needs.
Do the air chambers deflate or lose air?
Expand/Collapse
Solaire's air chambers will continue to expand slightly for 24 to 48 hours after they've been inflated for the first time. So you may notice that your sheets are a little loose for the first night or two.
During the first few days, while the chambers and other components relax and stabilize, the comfort level readout may fluctuate from what you originally set. Simply tap the memory button on your remote to bring it back to your preferred comfort setting. This will resolve within the first week.
Can side sleepers use adjustable beds?
Expand/Collapse
Yes! Adjustable air mattresses allow you to personalize your bed firmness to find the level that best conforms to your body, taking the pressure off your hips and shoulders and putting your spine in healthy alignment for deep, restful sleep.
How long do adjustable beds last?
Expand/Collapse
A typical adjustable air mattress should last for 8 or more years with normal use. Because they have mechanical components, you may have to replace or repair one or more of the moving parts down the line. The good news is, our Solaire Adjustable Mattress comes with the most generous
warranty
for an adjustable air mattress in the industry. All parts are 100% covered for the first five years and all labor is 100% covered for the next 15 years!
What is Upper-Flex?
Expand/Collapse
Upper-Flex Queen and Upper-Flex King are options for our Solaire adjustable firmness mattress. When paired with our Saatva Adjustable Base Plus in the Upper-Flex option, it gives each sleeper the freedom to raise the head of the bed independently and raise the foot of bed in unison.
With the standard queen and king options, the head and feet move together when adjusted.
The split on an Upper- Flex measures 30'' down from the head.
NOTE: The Upper-Flex is different from a split king, which is two separate twin XLs placed side by side. A split king or split Cal king Solaire gives each sleeper the freedom to raise the head and the feet of the mattress independently, making it our most customizable mattress.
Do Saatva mattresses contain fiberglass or a fiberglass sock?
Expand/Collapse
No. We never use fiberglass or toxic chemical flame retardants/barriers in any of our mattresses. Instead, we use either a plant-based flame barrier made of thistle pulp, a Paladin flame barrier made with a blend of poly & rayon fibers, or organic New Zealand wool in our mattresses to meet federal safety standards.
See Specifications under "Eco-friendly materials" for more details.
How do I clean my mattress?
Expand/Collapse
As part of regular maintenance, vacuum your mattress at least twice a year to get rid of dust, crumbs, and other icky things that might be living in there. You can also deodorize your mattress by generously sprinkling it with baking soda. Leave it on for a full day and then vacuum it up to refresh your mattress.
Tip:
Adding a
mattress pad
over your mattress gives it an added layer of protection from stains, moisture, and debris. Just make sure to wash your mattress pad regularly.

blog
.
What is the best mattress for back pain?
Expand/Collapse
Picking the right mattress to help ease back pain starts with assessing your typical sleep position,  then choosing a mattress that best supports you in that position. No matter what kind of mattress you choose,
the best mattresses for back pain
should include firmer support zones for optimal spinal alignment.

        Every Saatva mattress is engineered with a dedicated lumbar zone support layer to promote healthy spinal alignment for every type of sleeper.
Do adjustable beds fit in a regular bed frame?
Expand/Collapse
Yes. Just like other types of mattresses, an adjustable air mattress needs to sit on a foundation or platform base for support. For the most customizable sleep experience, we recommend pairing our Solaire Adjustable Mattress with our
Saatva Adjustable Base Plus
, which is compatible with any type of bed frame.
Can I use a headboard with an adjustable bed?
Expand/Collapse
Yes. Our Solaire Adjustable Mattress is compatible with
bed frames
that have an attached headboard. Just make sure your adjustable mattress sits on top of a foundation or our Saatva Adjustable Base Plus when using a non-platform bed frame.
Will my Saatva mattress work with my existing box spring or foundation?
Expand/Collapse
You can use your existing box spring or foundation if:
You purchased your box spring or foundation within the last 7 years.
Your existing box spring or foundation is in good condition and provides sturdy center support.
You don't mind not having a matching foundation.
NOTE:
Saatva HD
requires pairing with the HD Foundation for adequate support.
Saatva mattresses also work with
platform beds
, without the need for a foundation. Please make sure your existing platform bed has:
A solid, durable surface.
If your platform has a slatted support system, make sure the slats are spaced less than 4" apart. If they're not, you can add a 1/2" thick piece of plywood to place on top. This extra layer of support is needed because Saatva mattresses are heavier due to their premium quality materials.
A proper center support.
This means you must have a center leg in the middle of your platform bed frame.
NOTE: Must add a solid surface over platform slats such as plywood, masonite board, or bunkie board, when used with the dual-sided Zenhaven latex mattress.
If you have any questions, you can reach one of our sleep guides 24/7 at
1-877-672-2882
.
What bed frames are Saatva mattresses compatible with?
Expand/Collapse
Saatva mattresses are compatible with any bed frame, including our Saatva bed frames.
Our dual-sided Zenhaven latex mattresses cannot be placed directly on a platform bed frame with slats. You must cover the slats with a solid material, such as plywood or a
bunkie board
.
Non-platform (standard) bed frames require a foundation and can be paired with any mattress. Note that Saatva HD requires pairing with the HD foundation, which is specifically designed to give it optimal support.
What is CertiPUR-US®?
Expand/Collapse
Foams that are CertiPUR-US® certified are guaranteed to be low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), so you don’t have to worry about off-gassing odors. CertiPUR-US certified foams are also guaranteed to be free of ozone depleters, PBDEs, TDCPP, and TCEP flame retardants, mercury, lead, and other heavy metals, formaldehyde, and phthalates.
What's in your exclusive Guardin™ antimicrobial treatment?
Expand/Collapse
Our exclusive antimicrobial treatment by Guardin™ is made with a proprietary blend of all-natural essential oils and minerals. This blend includes thyme, geranium, lemongrass, and mint, but is completely odorless and colorless.
Added to Saatva’s mattress ticking during the manufacturing process and engineered to last the life of the mattress, Guardin™ naturally inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, mildew, and the discoloration that they can cause on the surface of a mattress. Guardin™ antimicrobial treatment is biodegradable and does not contain any fluorocarbons, toxic heavy metals, silver nanotechnology, triclosan, formaldehyde or phthalates.
What are the benefits of the Extend protection plan?
Expand/Collapse
The Extend protection plan provides peace of mind and financial protection for your mattress investment from accidental damage.
This plan covers accidental stains and damage NOT covered by the Saatva
mattress warranty
, such as rips, tears and stains. This plan does not cover theft or damage caused by abuse or misuse.
Plans are effective from the day your mattress is delivered.

Extend page

Can I try your mattresses in person?
Expand/Collapse
Yes!
Our Saatva Viewing Rooms
are inviting, pressure-free spaces to experience Saatva comfort in real life.
What is white glove delivery?
Expand/Collapse
White glove delivery is the Saatva service standard and comes free with every mattress, bedroom furniture and rug order. While our teams don't actually wear white gloves, we do all the work for you.
We hand-deliver your mattress and set it up in the room of your choice. We also take away your old mattress and foundation* if you select the "free mattress & foundation removal" at checkout—all at no extra charge!
Typically, mattress orders are delivered from our factories within a 9-21 day time frame, depending on your zip code.
Our bedroom furniture is also hand-delivered and assembled (if applicable) and bedroom rugs are delivered and set up in the room of your choice (rug area must be cleared of furniture by customer prior to delivery). You get all this for free as part of our premium white glove delivery service.
*Note that there are a few items our delivery teams won't take away the following items:
Waterbed bases
Standard metal bed frames
Sleep Number bases
Stained and/or damaged mattresses & foundations/box springs
What if I need to return my mattress?
Expand/Collapse
If you aren't completely happy with your Saatva mattress during your 365-night home trial, just give us a call at
1-877-672-2882
. We’ll schedule a pick up of your mattress and issue a refund for the purchase price (taxes included) to your original method of payment.
You’ll only pay a $99 processing fee and we’ll take care of the rest!
We never resell returned mattresses. Instead, we donate them to veterans' shelters or offer them to employees and associates across our network of more than 150 delivery centers.
Our Crib Mattress is an exception with a 45-day free return.
What if I need to exchange my mattress?
Expand/Collapse
If you decide to exchange your mattress for another Saatva mattress during your 365-night home trial, just give us a call at
1-877-672-2882
. We’ll schedule a pick up of your mattress and start the exchange process.
You’ll only pay a $99 processing fee for your replacement delivery and mattress pickup, and we’ll take care of the rest!
We never resell exchanged mattresses. Instead, we donate them to veterans' shelters or offer them to employees and associates across our network of more than 150 delivery centers.
            Once your new mattress is delivered, a new 365-night home trial begins.
We’ve learned that the most common reason people exchange is for a different mattress size or height, so be sure to measure the height of your bed frame, adjustable base, and/or foundation/box spring before ordering. You can also call one of our friendly sleep guides for assistance 24/7.
Can I expedite the delivery of my mattress?
Expand/Collapse
Every Saatva mattress is made to order, which means they don't sit in storage.
Occasionally, we can shorten the delivery time when we have a change or cancellation from another order of the exact same product. This allows us to redirect that freshly made and sealed mattress to you. We’d love to help in any way if you need your mattress faster. Our friendly sleep guides are here for you 24/7 at
1-877-672-2882
.
What do I do if I think my mattress feels too firm when I receive it?
Expand/Collapse
All of our mattresses are made to order and arrive to you factory fresh. That means the high-quality materials inside them need a little bit of time to soften up. You should notice your new mattress begin to conform to your body after a few days. You may even notice continuing improvement for up to a month.
Remember that your body will need some time to
adjust to a brand new mattress.
If you've been sleeping on an old mattress, your body likely got used to it, even if it didn't provide you with adequate support. That's why we give you a generous 365-night home trial to give you time to acclimate to your new mattress.
If after a month or so, you still feel that your mattress is too firm (or too soft), give us a call at
1-877-672-2882
and one of our friendly sleep guides will be happy to help you.
Does Saatva offer any discounts to first responders, veterans, active military & more?
Expand/Collapse
We offer a year-round $225 discount off orders of $1,000 or more to active military, veterans, first responders, government employees, nurses, teachers, senior citizens & students. To apply the discount, simply click on the "Discount for first responders & more" box at checkout. You will be prompted to register with ID.me to verify your status and receive the discount. Note that your cart will automatically apply the larger discount if there is a promotional sale on Saatva.com that is better than your ID.me discount.
We also occasionally offer promotional sales for limited time periods on our products on Saatva.com and Saatva Viewing Rooms. To be one of the first to learn about our latest sales, sign up for our mailing list at our site footer or text BED to SAATVA (722882). You can unsubscribe at any time.
Are your phone and store representatives on commission?
Expand/Collapse
No. It’s part of our pledge to be honest and transparent about what you’re buying. Saatva is committed to giving you honest guidance, even if it means directing you to another mattress brand that’s a better fit for you. In a regular mattress store environment, a commissioned employee makes more money when they sell you a particular brand, so you may get pressured into a choice that’s not right for you. That’s just not the Saatva way.
What are the advantages of mattresses that are made in America?
Expand/Collapse
Mattresses made in the U.S.A. must meet strict health, safety, and environmental standards. The U.S. and the E.U. have the toughest regulations, but other countries may not offer the same protections.
Knowing where your mattress is made makes it easier to ensure that the manufacturer adheres to guidelines that protect workers from danger and exploitation, such as labor regulations and minimum-wage laws. Reputable mattresses manufacturers (like our network of 19 independent factories across the U.S.) also work to minimize environmental impact by incorporating low-carbon-footprint processes and recycled materials into their products.
