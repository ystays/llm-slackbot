Frequently asked questions
What is a quilt?
Expand/Collapse
A traditional quilt is made of a three layer construction: a top side textile (typically cotton or linen), a thin middle layer of batting (typically some type of poly, wool, or cotton fill) that determines the warmth of the quilt, and a bottom side textile that is soft to the touch but also more durable. As the name suggests, these three layers are quilted together, usually with a quilt pattern like diamond, channel, pick-stitch, etc.
What’s the difference between a quilt and a comforter?
Expand/Collapse
Quilts are lighter, thinner, and less lofty than typical
comforters or duvet inserts
. Quilts are a great option for the warmer months or to add a layer of warmth on top of your comforter. Comforters are warmer and more insulated than quilts on their own because they have more fill material. Quilts sit more flush to your bed than a fluffy, lofty comforter or duvet insert.
What is the difference between a blanket and quilt?
Expand/Collapse
The main difference is in their construction. A blanket is a single layer that’s either woven, crocheted, or knitted. Blankets vary in thickness and can be used alone or as a layer on top of a top sheet or with a comforter for added warmth.
A quilt is constructed with three layers. It has an outer shell consisting of a top and bottom layer, plus a batting or fill made of either wool, down, cotton, polyester, rayon or a combination of those materials. Quilts also serve the same purpose of keeping you warm. It can be used alone or layered with other bedding.
What’s the difference between cotton and viscose?
Expand/Collapse
While cotton is a natural fiber woven from cotton plant seed pods, viscose is a manufactured fiber made from regenerated cellulose fibers (wood pulp) and is a part of the rayon family of fabrics. It is sometimes referred to as “rayon viscose”.
Both offer excellent breathability and a soft feel. Cotton is the more durable fabric of the two, especially when it absorbs moisture. Viscose is less durable, but when blended with cotton, it imparts a silky luster, extra softness, and a nice drape to the fabric.
What is OEKO-TEX®?
Expand/Collapse
The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is the internationally accepted standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings. Products that carry the OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 seal have been tested to ensure they're free of toxic chemicals.

Will you offer more colors in the future?
Expand/Collapse
Our current bedding color options are thoughtfully curated to fit a more neutral color palette because they complement almost any room style with timeless simplicity. In keeping with our eco-friendly ethos, we either leave the natural fabric undyed in its beautiful natural state or use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes for our bed sheets.
