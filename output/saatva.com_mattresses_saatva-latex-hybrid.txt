Frequently asked questions
What is a latex hybrid mattress?
Expand/Collapse
This type of hybrid mattress combines the pressure-free support of latex with the responsive support and "bouncy" feel of a classic innerspring mattress. They're great for just about all types of sleepers, whether you're a back sleeper, side sleeper, or a combination of both.
Do latex mattresses off-gas?
Expand/Collapse
No. Since natural latex is a plant-based material and doesn't emit VOCs (volatile organic compounds), you don't have to worry about chemical odors that come from off gassing.
Is a latex mattress good for a bad back?
Expand/Collapse
Yes! Latex mattresses are contouring yet responsive, giving you a balance of comfort and support to ensure proper spinal alignment. Our latex mattresses also have enhanced lumbar support to keep your back from sinking out of alignment.
For more severe back issues, our natural latex mattress is compatible with an
adjustable base
, allowing you to lift your legs and head to take more pressure off of your back.
Do latex mattresses sleep hot?
Expand/Collapse
Latex mattresses have an open cell structure that makes them naturally breathable, so your body stays at a comfortable temperature throughout the night. Our natural latex mattress is made even more breathable thanks to its organic cotton cover and New Zealand wool layer, which is known to naturally regulate body temperature.
How thick should a hybrid mattress be?
Expand/Collapse
Picking a mattress height is a matter of preference and also depends on your current bed setup. Our Saatva Latex Hybrid mattress is 12" high and can sit directly on top of a platform bed without a foundation. Keep in mind that the top layers are what determine the "feel" of a mattress. The third layer of our Latex Hybrid is made up of 3" of natural latex, which gives the bed its responsive, pressure-free support and buoyant feel.
If you prefer a taller bed, you can place your hybrid mattress on our 8.75"
foundation and add a metal frame
that sits 7.5" off the ground.
Are hybrid mattresses good for side sleepers?
Expand/Collapse
Yes! The Talalay latex layer in our Saatva Latex Hybrid is particularly great for side sleepers. Its responsive support relieves pressure points on your shoulders and hips by conforming to your body and keeping your spine in healthy alignment.
How long do hybrid mattresses last?
Expand/Collapse
With normal use, a high-quality hybrid mattress like our Saatva Latex Hybrid should last upwards of 10 years.
What if I have a latex allergy?
Expand/Collapse
The natural latex we use in some of our mattresses, as well as our Saatva Latex Pillow and Latex Mattress Topper,  goes through a thorough washing process to remove all allergy-causing proteins. Additionally, the latex layer never actually comes into contact with the skin, making it safe even for those with latex allergies.
What if I have a wool allergy?
Expand/Collapse
The certified organic New Zealand wool used in our Latex Hybrid and Zenhaven mattress is washed five times with fresh water to remove lanolin allergens. Lanolin, a natural substance found in wool, is the most common cause of rare wool allergies.
Additionally, the wool layer in our mattresses never actually comes into contact with the skin. It’s underneath our soft cover made with naturally hypoallergenic organic cotton.
Do latex mattresses get softer over time?
Expand/Collapse
Just like breaking in a new pair of leather shoes, your body might need some time to adapt to a new latex mattress, especially if you've never slept on one before. Because our Zenhaven natural latex mattress are made fresh to order, some customers find that it takes a bit longer for their mattress to relax and feel "just right". That's why we give you a generous 365-night home trial, so there's no pressure to make up your mind quickly.
Do Saatva mattresses contain fiberglass or a fiberglass sock?
Expand/Collapse
No. We never use fiberglass or toxic chemical flame retardants/barriers in any of our mattresses. Instead, we use either a plant-based flame barrier made of thistle pulp, a Paladin flame barrier made with a blend of poly & rayon fibers, or organic New Zealand wool in our mattresses to meet federal safety standards.
See Specifications under "Eco-friendly materials" for more details.
What is off gassing?
Expand/Collapse
Off gassing is the term for what happens when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) leak out of upholstery materials and mattress foams and into the air you breathe.
Some people refer to this as a "new mattress smell" that can range from unpleasant to downright nauseating.
Learn more on our
blog
about off gassing and how Saatva mattresses cut down or completely eliminate this common issue.
Do I need to flip over or rotate my mattress regularly?
Expand/Collapse
Our Zenhaven, Latex Hybrid, and Solaire mattresses do not need to be rotated from head to foot. This is due to the 5-zone alignment of the latex layer.
Our other mattresses can be rotated. We recommend rotating the mattress after six months and then once a year after that. This will ensure that the surface of the mattress breaks in evenly.
How do I clean my mattress?
Expand/Collapse
As part of regular maintenance, vacuum your mattress at least twice a year to get rid of dust, crumbs, and other icky things that might be living in there. You can also deodorize your mattress by generously sprinkling it with baking soda. Leave it on for a full day and then vacuum it up to refresh your mattress.
Tip:
Adding a
mattress pad
over your mattress gives it an added layer of protection from stains, moisture, and debris. Just make sure to wash your mattress pad regularly.

blog
.
What is the best mattress for back pain?
Expand/Collapse
Picking the right mattress to help ease back pain starts with assessing your typical sleep position,  then choosing a mattress that best supports you in that position. No matter what kind of mattress you choose,
the best mattresses for back pain
should include firmer support zones for optimal spinal alignment.

        Every Saatva mattress is engineered with a dedicated lumbar zone support layer to promote healthy spinal alignment for every type of sleeper.
Will my Saatva mattress work with my existing box spring or foundation?
Expand/Collapse
You can use your existing box spring or foundation if:
You purchased your box spring or foundation within the last 7 years.
Your existing box spring or foundation is in good condition and provides sturdy center support.
You don't mind not having a matching foundation.
NOTE:
Saatva HD
requires pairing with the HD Foundation for adequate support.
Saatva mattresses also work with
platform beds
, without the need for a foundation. Please make sure your existing platform bed has:
A solid, durable surface.
If your platform has a slatted support system, make sure the slats are spaced less than 4" apart. If they're not, you can add a 1/2" thick piece of plywood to place on top. This extra layer of support is needed because Saatva mattresses are heavier due to their premium quality materials.
A proper center support.
This means you must have a center leg in the middle of your platform bed frame.
NOTE: Must add a solid surface over platform slats such as plywood, masonite board, or bunkie board, when used with the dual-sided Zenhaven latex mattress.
If you have any questions, you can reach one of our sleep guides 24/7 at
1-877-672-2882
.
Do hybrid mattresses need a box spring or foundation?
Expand/Collapse
You don’t need a box spring or foundation if you have a platform bed. Otherwise, if your existing foundation or bed support system is over 7 years old or is sagging or damaged in any way, we suggest getting a high-quality
Saatva foundation
to get the most out of your new mattress. Your mattress warranty remains in place even when you use your own existing foundation or box spring.
What bed frames are Saatva mattresses compatible with?
Expand/Collapse
Saatva mattresses are compatible with any bed frame, including our Saatva bed frames.
Our dual-sided Zenhaven latex mattresses cannot be placed directly on a platform bed frame with slats. You must cover the slats with a solid material, such as plywood or a bunkie board.
Non-platform (standard) bed frames require a foundation and can be paired with any mattress. Note that Saatva HD requires pairing with the HD foundation, which is specifically designed to give it optimal support.
What is GOTS?
Expand/Collapse
The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is the leading textile processing standard for organic fibers. Fabrics that carry the GOTS symbol must be made with at least 95% organic fiber, free of toxic chemicals, colored with nontoxic dyes, and meet strict social and environmental criteria. Our Saatva Latex Hybrid features 100% GOTS certified organic cotton and wool.
What is GOLS?
Expand/Collapse
For natural latex to hold the GOLS symbol, it is required to contain a minimum of 95% certified raw organic material. It must also adhere to GOLS limits on harmful chemicals, fillers, and emissions. GOLS tracks latex throughout the supply chain, from harvest to final product, to ensure it is manufactured sustainably.
What is eco-INSTITUT?
Expand/Collapse
eco-INSTITUT is a German organization responsible for testing products for harmful chemicals. Materials with the eco-INSTITUT certification, like our natural latex, are guaranteed to be free of pollutants and emissions, meaning they won’t off-gas in your home.
What is GREENGUARD Gold certified?
Expand/Collapse
GREENGUARD Certified products are certified to GREENGUARD standards for low chemical emissions into indoor air during product usage.
By purchasing products that carry this certification, you’re helping reduce indoor air pollution and your family’s risk of daily chemical exposure to potentially harmful substances like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), phthalates, and formaldehyde.
What's in your exclusive Guardin™ antimicrobial treatment?
Expand/Collapse
Our exclusive antimicrobial treatment by Guardin™ is made with a proprietary blend of all-natural essential oils and minerals. This blend includes thyme, geranium, lemongrass, and mint, but is completely odorless and colorless.
Added to Saatva’s mattress ticking during the manufacturing process and engineered to last the life of the mattress, Guardin™ naturally inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, mildew, and the discoloration that they can cause on the surface of a mattress. Guardin™ antimicrobial treatment is biodegradable and does not contain any fluorocarbons, toxic heavy metals, silver nanotechnology, triclosan, formaldehyde or phthalates.
What are the benefits of the Extend protection plan?
Expand/Collapse
The Extend protection plan provides peace of mind and financial protection for your mattress investment from accidental damage.
This plan covers accidental stains and damage NOT covered by the Saatva
mattress warranty
, such as rips, tears and stains. This plan does not cover theft or damage caused by abuse or misuse.

Extend page

Can I try your mattresses in person?
Expand/Collapse
Yes!
Our Saatva Viewing Rooms
are inviting, pressure-free spaces to experience Saatva comfort in real life.
What is white glove delivery?
Expand/Collapse
White glove delivery is the Saatva service standard and comes free with every mattress, bedroom furniture and rug order. While our teams don't actually wear white gloves, we do all the work for you.
We hand-deliver your mattress and set it up in the room of your choice. We also take away your old mattress and foundation* if you select the "free mattress & foundation removal" at checkout—all at no extra charge!
Typically, mattress orders are delivered from our factories within a 9-21 day time frame, depending on your zip code.
Our bedroom furniture is also hand-delivered and assembled (if applicable) and bedroom rugs are delivered and set up in the room of your choice (rug area must be cleared of furniture by customer prior to delivery). You get all this for free as part of our premium white glove delivery service.
*Note that there are a few items our delivery teams won't take away the following items:
Waterbed bases
Standard metal bed frames
Sleep Number bases
Stained and/or damaged mattresses & foundations/box springs
What if I need to return my mattress?
Expand/Collapse
If you aren't completely happy with your Saatva mattress during your 365-night home trial, just give us a call at
1-877-672-2882
. We’ll schedule a pick up of your mattress and issue a refund for the purchase price (taxes included) to your original method of payment.

Our Crib Mattress is an exception with a 45-day free return.
What if I need to exchange my mattress?
Expand/Collapse
If you decide to exchange your mattress for another Saatva mattress during your 365-night home trial, just give us a call at
1-877-672-2882
. We’ll schedule a pick up of your mattress and start the exchange process.
You’ll only pay a $99 processing fee for your replacement delivery and mattress pickup, and we’ll take care of the rest!
We never resell exchanged mattresses. Instead, we donate them to veterans' shelters or offer them to employees and associates across our network of more than 150 delivery centers.
            Once your new mattress is delivered, a new 365-night home trial begins.
We’ve learned that the most common reason people exchange is for a different mattress size or height, so be sure to measure the height of your bed frame, adjustable base, and/or foundation/box spring before ordering. You can also call one of our friendly sleep guides for assistance 24/7.
Can I expedite the delivery of my mattress?
Expand/Collapse
Every Saatva mattress is made to order, which means they don't sit in storage.
Occasionally, we can shorten the delivery time when we have a change or cancellation from another order of the exact same product. This allows us to redirect that freshly made and sealed mattress to you. We’d love to help in any way if you need your mattress faster. Our friendly sleep guides are here for you 24/7 at
1-877-672-2882
.
What do I do if I think my mattress feels too firm when I receive it?
Expand/Collapse
All of our mattresses are made to order and arrive to you factory fresh. That means the high-quality materials inside them need a little bit of time to soften up. You should notice your new mattress begin to conform to your body after a few days. You may even notice continuing improvement for up to a month.
Remember that your body will need some time to
adjust to a brand new mattress.
If you've been sleeping on an old mattress, your body likely got used to it, even if it didn't provide you with adequate support. That's why we give you a generous 365-night home trial to give you time to acclimate to your new mattress.
If after a month or so, you still feel that your mattress is too firm (or too soft), give us a call at
1-877-672-2882
and one of our friendly sleep guides will be happy to help you.
Does Saatva offer any discounts to first responders, veterans, active military & more?
Expand/Collapse
We offer a year-round $225 discount off orders of $1,000 or more to active military, veterans, first responders, government employees, nurses, teachers, senior citizens & students. To apply the discount, simply click on the "Discount for first responders & more" box at checkout. You will be prompted to register with ID.me to verify your status and receive the discount. Note that your cart will automatically apply the larger discount if there is a promotional sale on Saatva.com that is better than your ID.me discount.
We also occasionally offer promotional sales for limited time periods on our products on Saatva.com and Saatva Viewing Rooms. To be one of the first to learn about our latest sales, sign up for our mailing list at our site footer or text BED to SAATVA (722882). You can unsubscribe at any time.
Are your phone and store representatives on commission?
Expand/Collapse
No. It’s part of our pledge to be honest and transparent about what you’re buying. Saatva is committed to giving you honest guidance, even if it means directing you to another mattress brand that’s a better fit for you. In a regular mattress store environment, a commissioned employee makes more money when they sell you a particular brand, so you may get pressured into a choice that’s not right for you. That’s just not the Saatva way.
What are the advantages of mattresses that are made in America?
Expand/Collapse
Mattresses made in the U.S.A. must meet strict health, safety, and environmental standards. The U.S. and the E.U. have the toughest regulations, but other countries may not offer the same protections.
Knowing where your mattress is made makes it easier to ensure that the manufacturer adheres to guidelines that protect workers from danger and exploitation, such as labor regulations and minimum-wage laws. Reputable mattresses manufacturers (like our network of 19 independent factories across the U.S.) also work to minimize environmental impact by incorporating low-carbon-footprint processes and recycled materials into their products.
