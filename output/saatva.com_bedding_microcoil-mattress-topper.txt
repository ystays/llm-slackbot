Frequently asked questions
What is a mattress topper and do I need one?
Expand/Collapse
Mattress toppers are designed to add a layer of cushioning, support, or change the initial feel to the surface of a mattress. They're great for adding support to older mattresses if you aren't quite ready to buy a new one. They're also helpful in breaking in a brand new mattress that might initially feel too firm. Mattress toppers are more substantial than mattress pads and protectors, typically around 1" to 4" in thickness.
What are the differences between a mattress topper, mattress pad, and mattress protector?
Expand/Collapse
Mattress toppers are more substantial than mattress pads and protectors, typically around 1" to 4" in thickness. Rather than protect your mattress, they're designed purely to add an extra layer of comfort and support to new or older mattresses.
A mattress pad is a thin quilted layer designed to protect your mattress from light stains and general wear & tear.
Mattress protectors are thinner like fitted sheets. They're primarily used to protect your mattress from spills and humidity, making them a great choice for kids, homes with pets, and humid climates. They're also great at keeping contaminants like mold, bacteria, and bed bugs out of your mattress.
How do I choose a mattress topper?
Expand/Collapse
Just like mattresses, there are different types of toppers for different sleep preferences and needs.
Latex mattress toppers are often recommended by orthopedists and chiropractors to relieve neck, back, and shoulder pain. They offer resilient yet responsive support and limit motion transfer. They're also more durable and breathable than memory foam toppers.
Memory foam mattress toppers are particularly great for back and side sleepers because they conform and contour to your curves and provide pressure-point relief. Like latex toppers, they also limit motion transfer.
Cooling mattress toppers, like our Graphite Memory Foam option, are great for those who tend to sleep hot because they draw heat away from the body.
How do I clean a mattress topper?
Expand/Collapse
Spot clean as needed, preferably with a mild, organic cleaning solution.
How long do mattress toppers last?
Expand/Collapse
You should expect to replace your topper after about three to five years. This also depends on other factors like the quality of the latex, high-density foam, or memory foam, the age and condition of the mattress, and the thickness of the mattress topper.
If you're looking for the most durable mattress topper material available, go for a latex mattress topper.
Can you put a new mattress topper on an old mattress?
Expand/Collapse
Yes. One of the main functions of a mattress topper is giving new life to an old mattress. Add a mattress topper that suits your sleep style over your old mattress if you’re not quite ready to invest in a brand new mattress.
Do mattress toppers make a bed more comfortable?
Expand/Collapse
Yes. Adding a mattress topper to an older mattress instantly improves the feel and support of your bed. Adding one over your brand new mattress is also a great way to help with the break-in period.
What's the best mattress topper for back pain?
Expand/Collapse
Latex and memory foam mattress toppers are best for those who suffer from back pain because they contour to your body, promoting healthy spinal alignment and relieving pressure points.
What is the coil count in the Micro-Coil Mattress Topper?
Expand/Collapse
The coil count in the 1" micro-coil layer of our Micro-Coil Topper varies by size:
Twin: 966
Twin XL: 1,012
Full: 1,344
Queen: 1,628
King: 2,024
California King: 2,040
What is the coil gauge of the coils in the Micro-Coil Mattress Topper?
Expand/Collapse
The recycled steel coils in our micro-coil topper are 18 gauge.
What is CertiPUR-US®?
Expand/Collapse
Foams that are CertiPUR-US® certified are guaranteed to be low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), so you don’t have to worry about off-gassing odors. CertiPUR-US certified foams are also guaranteed to be free of ozone depleters, PBDEs, TDCPP, and TCEP flame retardants, mercury, lead, and other heavy metals, formaldehyde, and phthalates.
What is your return policy for mattress toppers?
Expand/Collapse
Mattress toppers returned within 180 days of the delivery date will get a full refund to the original form of payment.
To make a return, simply call 1-888-722-4164 or email info@saatvamattress.com. If you received our topper as a gift, please call us for help with your return.
What is the exchange policy for bedding?
Expand/Collapse
At this time we do not have an exchange policy for Saatva bedding. If you would like to exchange your merchandise, simply return your order and repurchase the item of your choice.
Does Saatva offer any discounts to first responders, veterans, active military & more?
Expand/Collapse
