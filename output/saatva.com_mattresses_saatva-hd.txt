Every Saatva mattress is made to order and handcrafted in America with care and pride, using only the highest quality, consciously sourced materials. We could have settled on cheaper materials and produced our products elsewhere for higher profits, but we've never wavered in our commitment to quality. We believe it's the right thing to do for our customers, our American workers, and our economy.

Guardin™ nontoxic, botanical antimicrobial treatment
CertiPUR-US® certified foams that meet their standards for health and environmental safety
Natural latex that's free of toxic chemicals, emissions, and pollutants

Delivery & setup
Expand/Collapse
Sit back and relax while we do all the work. Our free white glove delivery includes in-room delivery and set up. We'll even take away your old mattress at no additional cost to you. Just select free mattress removal at checkout.
365-night home trial
Expand/Collapse
At Saatva, we never pressure you to make up your mind quickly. All of our mattresses come with a 365-night home trial, so you have plenty of time to decide whether it’s right for you. If at any point during your home trial you’re not satisfied, just give us a call and we’ll come pick up the mattress and refund your money, less a $99 processing fee to cover our cost of gas and labor for the pickup. That’s it.
HD foundation
Expand/Collapse
Our high-durability wood slat HD foundation is specifically designed to use with our Saatva HD mattress. It's stronger than a standard mattress foundation or box spring and engineered to provide optimal support.
It's available in two heights: 4.75" for those who prefer a lower bed and 8.75" for those who prefer a taller bed.
As an alternative to the HD foundation, our Saatva HD mattress can also be placed on one of our Saatva platform bed frames without the need for a foundation.
