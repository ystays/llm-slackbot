Does a wool rug shed?
Expand/Collapse
All natural wool rugs, no matter the price point, shed to some degree. The good news is there are ways to reduce shedding, starting with choosing a high-quality wool rug.
The higher the quality of the wool, the less the rug will shed overall. The amount of shedding also depends on the way the rug is crafted.
Lastly, newer rugs tend to experience more shedding because during the rug making process, the fibers are cut down to the desired pile height, leaving some pieces of fiber stuck in the rug. Vacuum your wool rug regularly (with the vacuum’s beater bar off, if possible) to reduce shedding. You can expect shedding to subside after a few months with regular care and vacuuming.
How do I clean my bedroom rug?
Expand/Collapse
Blot stains immediately and clean with mild soap and cold water. Blot dry with a clean, absorbent towel. Avoid prolonged exposure to moisture. Shedding is normal. Vacuum regularly with the beater bar off, going with the grain of the pile, and shedding will reduce over time.
What kind of rug is best for the bedroom?
Expand/Collapse
Bedroom rugs are a great way to tie a bedroom together. On hard floors, they give your feet something warm and soft to land on and they also help muffle downstairs sounds in upstairs bedrooms.
Look for bedroom rugs woven from soft, high-quality fibers like PET yarn, wool (or wool blends), and cotton.
Bedrooms typically see less foot traffic than living rooms or hallways, but a rug designed for use in medium or high-traffic areas will ensure your bedroom rug will last for years to come, even if you decide to move the rug to the living room.
Where should a rug be placed in a bedroom?
Expand/Collapse
An area rug under the bed is the most common placement, but depending on your room size and furniture layout, you have room to get creative!
Placing an area rug under your bed gives a nice focal point to a bedroom. It instantly makes the space feel more cohesive. You can either place the rug all the way up against the wall to the headboard, or stop short of the side tables. It depends on how much space you have and other
bedroom furniture
you want to place over the rug.
What is a good rug size for a bedroom?
Expand/Collapse
It simply comes down to choosing a rug size that complements the size of your bed and your bedroom layout.
A queen size bed sits perfectly on an 8’ x 10’ area rug. A king size bed or two twin beds work great on a larger 9’ x 12’ rug, but you can also go for an extra-large 10’ by 14’ rug to accommodate larger
bedroom furniture
or pieces like a
bedroom bench
at the end of the bed.
A Cal king bed also pairs best with a roomy 10’ x 14’ bedroom rug.
