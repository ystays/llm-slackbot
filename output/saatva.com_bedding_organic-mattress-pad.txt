Frequently asked questions
What is a mattress pad and do I need one?
Expand/Collapse
A mattress pad, sometimes called a mattress cover, is a thin piece of quilted material that fits over the surface of your mattress, much like a fitted sheet. It offers an extra layer of light cushioning and much-needed protection against light stains and general wear and tear.
What are the differences between a mattress topper, mattress pad, and mattress protector?
Expand/Collapse
Mattress toppers are more substantial than mattress pads and protectors, typically around 1" to 4" in thickness. Rather than protect your mattress, they're designed purely to add an extra layer of comfort and support to new or older mattresses.
A mattress pad is a thin quilted layer designed to protect your mattress from light stains and general wear & tear.
Mattress protectors are thinner like fitted sheets. They're primarily used to protect your mattress from spills and humidity, making them a great choice for kids, homes with pets, and humid climates. They're also great at keeping contaminants like mold, bacteria, and bed bugs out of your mattress.
Do I put a mattress pad over a memory foam topper?
Expand/Collapse
Yes, if your mattress pad is deep enough to accomodate the height/thickness of your mattress with a mattress topper. Our organic mattress pad fits mattresses up to 16" high.
How often do I replace a mattress pad?

A mattress protector is a thin sheet of fabric that's designed to safeguard your mattress from bacteria, fungi, bed bugs, and other unwanted contaminants. Mattress protectors can be waterproof, quilted, natural, or synthetic, and are typically washable.
Can a mattress pad make my mattress firmer?
Expand/Collapse
Mattress pads don't have enough cushioning and support to add firmness to a mattress. Most people use mattress pads to add a layer of softness and protection from regular wear and tear.
What is GOTS?

The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is the leading textile processing standard for organic fibers. Fabrics that carry the GOTS symbol must be made with at least 95% organic fiber, free of toxic chemicals, colored with nontoxic dyes, and meet strict social and environmental criteria.
What are Fair Trade Certified™ factories?
Expand/Collapse
Products from Fair Trade Certified™ factories are made according to rigorous social, environmental, and economic Fair Trade Standards. This means the farmers and workers behind that product earn additional money from your purchase to empower and uplift their communities.
